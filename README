OpenLink Ajax Toolkit (OAT)

Introduction
============

The OpenLink AJAX Toolkit (OAT) is a JavaScript-based toolkit for
browser-independent Rich Internet Application development. It includes
a rich collection of UI Widgets/Controls, Event Management System,
and a truly platform-independent Data Access Layer called AJAX Database
Connectivity.

Using this toolkit is as simple as including two .js files in the <head>
portion of an HTML document, and specifying a list of features you want
to use. The framework will build the dependency tree and dynamically
include all needed (and no other!) files.

OAT works in Gecko browsers (Firefox, Mozilla/SeaMonkey), IE6, IE7,
Opera and Apple WebKit.
